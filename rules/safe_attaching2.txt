# Another idea for safe attaching. Need to partition the states into ordinary ones and enzyme ones but
# I'm hoping we can find a way to do this.
# special states alpha=20, beta=21, gamma=22, delta=23, epsilon=24, zeta=25

type: A, B

# Initial condition
number of particles: 100
state max: 100
fill: A0 0.5, A1 0.5

# start with e.g. B20-B0-B1-B20 to capture A0 at one end and A1 at the other

# B20 joins temporarily with any A in an ordinary state:
A0 B20 -> A0-B21
A1 B20 -> A1-B21
# etc.
# (N.B we need a new notation for this. Intention: Ax B20 -> Ax-B21 where x is an ordinary state)

# B21 takes on the state of its neighboring B
B21-Bx -> Bx-Bx

# if A is bonded to a matching state then it means we've captured the right thing
A0-B0 -> A26-B22
A1-B1 -> A26-B22       
# etc.
# (N.B we need a new notation for this. Intention: Ax-Bx -> A26-B22 where x is an ordinary state)

# if A is now bonded to a non-matching state then it means we've captured the wrong thing, release and reset
A1-B0 -> A1 B20
A0-B1 -> A0 B20
# etc.
# (N.B. we need a new notation for this. Intention: Ax-By -> Ax B20 where x,y are ordinary states and x != y)

# we pass the message that we've bonded the right thing
B22-Bx -> Bx-B23
