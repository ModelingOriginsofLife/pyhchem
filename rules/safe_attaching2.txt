# Another idea for safe attaching.
# special states alpha=20, beta=21, gamma=22, delta=23, epsilon=24, zeta=25

type: A, B

# Initial condition
number of particles: 100
state max: 100
fill: A0 0.5, A1 0.5

# start with e.g. B20-B0-B24-B1-B20 to capture A0 at one end and A1 at the other

# B20 joins temporarily with any A in an ordinary state:
Ax B20 -> Ax-B21

# B21 takes on the state of its neighboring B
B21-Bx -> Bx-Bx

# if A is bonded to a matching state then it means we've captured the right thing
Ax-Bx -> A22-B22

# if A is now bonded to a non-matching state then it means we've captured the wrong thing, release and reset
Ax-By -> Ax B20 : 0.01
