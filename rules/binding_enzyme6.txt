# Working Matteo's 'sticky particles' from an email 2015-03-26 into a full binding enzyme (work in progress)
# special states alpha=20, beta=21, gamma=22, delta=23, epsilon=24, zeta=25

type: A, B, C

# Initial condition
number of particles: 100
state max: 100
fill: A0 0.5, A1 0.5

# AB particles with matching state are 'sticky'
Ax Bx -> Ax-Bx
Ax-Bx -> Ax Bx

# alpha is a runner
B20-Bx -> Bx-B20

# if alpha finds itself bonded to an A then we must have attached the right kind of A
B20-Ax -> B21-Ax

# detach the input carrier and allow the reactants to bind
Ax-B21 -> A20-B22 : 0.01
B22-B21 -> B23 B24
A20 A20 -> A21-A21

# attach the output carrier
B23 B25 -> B26-B27

# TODO: assign the output state, detach the reactants, reset the enzyme
