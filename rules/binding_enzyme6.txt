# Matteo's 'attach and grasp' from an email 2015-03-26
# special states alpha=20, beta=21, gamma=22, delta=23, epsilon=24, zeta=25

type: A, B, C

# Initial condition
number of particles: 100
state max: 100
fill: A0 0.5, A1 0.5

# start with e.g. B20-B0-... to capture A0 but enclose all but attachments points in inert C

# AB particles with matching state are 'sticky'
Ax Bx -> Ax-Bx
Ax-Bx -> Ax Bx

# alpha is a runner
B20-Bx -> Bx-B20

# if alpha finds itself bonded to an A then we must have attached the right kind of A
B20-Ax -> B21-Ax
