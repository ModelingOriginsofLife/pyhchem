# Tim trying to fix up Matteo's runner-driven binding enzyme
# special states: 0,1,...19 
# ordinary states: 20, 21, ...
type: A, B
# Initial condition
number of particles: 110
state max: 100
fill: A20 0.5, A21 0.5

# enzyme has form: B1 - B0 - Bi - Bp - B2 - Bq - Bj - B0 - B1
# which will catalyse Ai + Aj -> Ap-Aq

# e.g. B1 - B0 - B20 - B21 - B2 - B22 - B21 - B0 - B1 which should catalyse A20 + A21 -> A22-A23

# Rules
Ax Bx -> Ax-B3
Ax-B3 -> Ax Bx
B3-B0 -> B4-B5
B4-Ax -> Bx-A7
# problem 1: can bond on either side. have added two 'A19' atoms at the back but this is really horrid
# now B5 is a runner, moves randomly until reaches the B2 stopper (we want this to happen quickly)
B2-B5 -> B2-B6
B5-Bx -> Bx-B5
# problem 2: these reactions are checked in order. have put the stopper reaction before the runner reaction but this is horrid
A7 A7 -> A8-A8
A8-Bx -> Ax-B9
B9-B6 -> B10-B11
B10-Ax -> Bx Ax
# now the reaction product is released and we can reset
# B11 is now a runner, moves randomly until reaches the B1 stopper
B11-B2 -> B11-B2
B1-B11 -> B1-B0
B11-Bx -> Bx-B11 : 0.05
# problem 3: need dummy reaction to make sure the runner doesn't cross the middle

# problem 4, the enzyme falls apart sometimes. needs debugging.
